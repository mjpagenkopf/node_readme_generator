# readme generator   

# Description

This README Generator was created to provide consistent, professional looking markdown files for use with any project. I wanted a way to create README.md files so that I won't have to spend too much time thinking about structure or content of my README. I still don't have the license working properly so that will be something to go back and continue to fix. I did learn a great deal in how to operate node within the directory and npm, such as installed dependencies like inquirer, as well as writing files with fs.

## Installation

Must have Node installed to run. Install npm to directory and install the inquirer dependency to the package.json. Run "node index.js" and answer the prompt questions. Once you have completed the questions, you should see the message "success" in your terminal. This indicates you have successfully created your README.md file.
